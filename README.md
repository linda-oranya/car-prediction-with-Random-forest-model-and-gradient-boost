# car-prediction-with-Random-forest-model-and-gradient-boost
More work can be done in enhancing the output.
It first uses logistic regression and decision trees, then gradient boost to get predictions on prices of used cars.

Finally it uses Random forest to create a prediction and an auth api is created.
The code will be worked on continously to improve results and expose the api
